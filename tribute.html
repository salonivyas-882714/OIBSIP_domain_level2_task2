      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989, while working at CERN, he proposed a system to share information easily across computers. His idea became the web — using HTML, HTTP, and URLs to connect pages of information.

        He later founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure the web remains open and accessible to all. Berners-Lee’s vision changed how people communicate, learn, and share knowledge.
